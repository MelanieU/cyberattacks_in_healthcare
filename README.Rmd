## Analysis of cyber attacks between 2017 and 2018

This project aimed to get a better understandong of what sectors are mostly affected by cyber attacks. The information was collected by scraping hackmageddon <https://www.hackmageddon.com/> and glassdoor for selected companies <https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm>.

The Scrapy_hackmageddon and Scrapy_glassdoor files contain the script for scarping the respective websites. In addition, the Analysis folder includes the python scripts for the glassdoor and hackmageddon datasets analysis together with a powerpoint presentation of my results. 

Enjoy!
